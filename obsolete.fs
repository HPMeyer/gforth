: find ( c-addr -- xt +-1 | c-addr 0 ) \ core,search
    \G Search all word lists in the current search order for the
    \G definition named by the counted string at @i{c-addr}.  If the
    \G definition is not found, return 0. If the definition is found
    \G return 1 (if the definition has non-default compilation
    \G semantics) or -1 (if the definition has default compilation
    \G semantics).  The @i{xt} returned in interpret state represents
    \G the interpretation semantics.  The @i{xt} returned in compile
    \G state represented either the compilation semantics (for
    \G non-default compilation semantics) or the run-time semantics
    \G that the compilation semantics would @code{compile,} (for
    \G default compilation semantics).  The ANS Forth standard does
    \G not specify clearly what the returned @i{xt} represents (and
    \G also talks about immediacy instead of non-default compilation
    \G semantics), so this word is questionable in portable programs.
    \G If non-portability is ok, @code{find-name} and friends are
    \G better (@pxref{Name token}).
