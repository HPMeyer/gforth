The Gforth manual is available on
https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/
or through your favourite info reader (e.g., "info gforth" from the shell)
or you can just type "help <word>" to display the relevant help section.
To leave Gforth, type "bye", or use Ctrl-D at the start of a line.
To input floating-point numbers, use an exponent, e.g. "1e".
To input double-cell integers without warnings, use a base-prefix and put
the '.' only in the last position, e.g. "#1.".
For better colors on dark background, type "black-colors".
Disable warnings with "warnings off" and reduce warnings with "-1 warnings !"
Config in ~/.config/gforthrc0 before loading anything, ~/.config/gforthrc for interactive mode
